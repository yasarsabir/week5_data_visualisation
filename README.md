Attributes of the original data****
The data was given into data sets. 
The first data sets contains all 249 mice, and shows the tumour volume and number of metastases at various points in time. Each mouse is not followed up the same amount of time, this is either because the mouse has died or incomplete data.

The second database called metadata, gives the treatment regimen for each mouse as well as the age, sex and weight of the mice

The remainder of my analysis is within the jupyter notebook.
